At Televista, we're not just another lead generation company. We're a team of dedicated professionals who are passionate about helping real estate investors to succeed. We understand that the quality of your leads is just as important as the quantity, and that's why we've developed a proprietary process for generating **high-intent real estate investor leads** that are exclusive to you. This guide will provide a transparent look at our process, helping you to understand what sets us apart from the competition.

## Our Philosophy: Quality Over Quantity

Many lead generation companies focus on delivering a high volume of leads, but they often sacrifice quality in the process. At Televista, we take a different approach. We believe that it's better to have a smaller number of high-quality leads than a large number of low-quality leads. That's why we've built our entire process around the goal of delivering **high-intent real estate investor leads** that are ready to sell.

## Our Process: A Multi-Channel Approach

We use a multi-channel approach to lead generation that combines the best of both online and offline marketing. This allows us to reach a wider audience and to generate a more diverse range of leads.

### 1. Data-Driven Targeting

It all starts with the data. We use a variety of data sources to identify homeowners who are most likely to be motivated to sell. This includes:

- **Public Records:** We analyze public records to identify homeowners who are facing foreclosure, who have recently gone through a divorce, or who have other life events that might motivate them to sell.
- **Predictive Analytics:** We use AI-powered predictive analytics to identify homeowners who are likely to sell in the near future, even if they haven't yet taken any steps to list their property.

### 2. A Personal Touch

Once we have identified a list of potential leads, we use a combination of cold calling and direct mail to reach out to them. We believe that a personal touch is essential for building rapport and for uncovering a homeowner's true motivation.

- **Cold Calling:** Our team of experienced cold callers are trained to be friendly, professional, and empathetic. They are not pushy salespeople; they are problem solvers who are there to help homeowners to find a solution to their real estate needs.

### 3. A Rigorous Qualification Process

Every lead that we generate goes through a rigorous qualification process to ensure that they are a good fit for our clients. Our qualification process includes:

- **A detailed questionnaire** to gather information about the lead's situation, their motivation, and their timeline.
- **A personal phone call** with one of our lead qualification specialists to verify the information and to answer any questions the lead may have.

## The Televista Difference: What Sets Us Apart

- **Exclusive Leads:** Unlike many other lead generation companies, we only sell our leads to one investor. This means that you'll never have to compete with other investors for the same lead.
- **A Dedicated Account Manager:** When you sign up with Televista, you'll be assigned a dedicated account manager who will be your single point of contact. Your account manager will work with you to understand your business and to ensure that you're getting the most out of our service.
