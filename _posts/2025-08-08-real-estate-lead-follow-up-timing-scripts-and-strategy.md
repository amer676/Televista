In the world of real estate investing, the old adage is true: the fortune is in the follow-up. A lead that is not followed up with is a lead that is lost. This guide will provide you with a comprehensive framework for **real estate lead follow up**, covering the timing, the scripts, and the strategy you need to turn your leads into deals.

## The Importance of a Follow-Up Strategy

A well-defined follow-up strategy is essential for a number of reasons:

*   **It builds trust and rapport.**

*   **It allows you to nurture leads over time.**
*   **It gives you a competitive advantage.**

## The Follow-Up Timeline: A Week-by-Week Guide

### Week 1: The Initial Contact

The first week is all about making a strong first impression and to gathering as much information as you can.

*   **Day 1:** Make initial contact with the lead.
*   **Day 2:** Send a follow-up email or a text message.
