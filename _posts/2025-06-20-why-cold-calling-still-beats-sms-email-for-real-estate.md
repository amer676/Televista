In the digital age, it's easy to get seduced by the latest and the greatest marketing trends. SMS and email marketing are all the rage, and they certainly have their place in a well-rounded lead generation strategy. But when it comes to finding off-market real estate deals, there is still one undisputed champion: cold calling. This guide will take a controversial and an unapologetic look at why cold calling still beats SMS and email for real estate, and why it's not even close.

## The Impersonal Nature of Digital Communication

Let's be honest: we are all bombarded with an endless stream of emails and text messages on a daily basis. We have become experts at ignoring, at deleting, and at unsubscribing from messages that we don't want to receive. And when you're trying to reach a homeowner who may be in a difficult or a stressful situation, an impersonal text message or an email is the last thing they want to receive.

## The Power of a Human Connection

Cold calling, on the other hand, allows you to make a genuine human connection with a homeowner. It allows you to build rapport, to ask questions, and to have a real conversation. In a world that is becoming increasingly digital, a human voice can be a powerful and a refreshing change of pace.

## Cold Calling vs. SMS vs. Email: A Head-to-Head Comparison

| **Cost** | Low. | Low. | Very low. |
| **Scalability** | Can be difficult to scale. | Highly scalable. | Highly scalable. |
| **Conversion Rate** | High. | Low. | Very low. |

## The Myth of the "Magic" SMS or Email Script

Many marketers will try to sell you on the idea of a "magic" SMS or email script that is guaranteed to get results. But the truth is that there is no magic script. The effectiveness of your message has less to do with the words you use and more to do with the medium you use to deliver it. A personal phone call will always be more effective than an impersonal text message or an email, no matter how well-written it is.

## Conclusion: The Un-sexy but Undisputed Champion

Cold calling may not be as sexy as SMS or email marketing, but it's still the undisputed champion of real estate lead generation. It's the most effective way to make a genuine human connection with a homeowner, to uncover their true motivation, and to close more deals. So, while your competitors are busy sending out mass text messages and email blasts, you can be on the phone, to have real conversations, and to be closing deals. The choice is clear.
